# MCP Crypto Alliance

## About MCP

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as **USB-C** provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to **connect AI models to different data sources and tools**.

## Our Vision

The Claude MCP Crypto Alliance aims to drive blockchain innovation by bringing advanced AI capabilities to cryptocurrency and Web3. Our mission is to:

* Enable seamless integration between AI models and blockchain data through standardized protocols
* Foster innovation in AI-powered crypto trading, analytics, and risk management
* Build a comprehensive ecosystem of crypto-focused MCP servers and tools
* Promote best practices in AI-crypto integration through open-source collaboration
* Accelerate the development of intelligent web3 applications and tools
